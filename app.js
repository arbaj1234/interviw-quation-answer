01 <= What is JavaScript ?
    JavaScript is a high - level, interpreted programming language that is widely
               used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

1 <= What are var let, and const 
              • var is function-scoped / global scoped and can be re - declared and re - assigned.
              • let is block-scoped and can be re - assigned, but not re - declared.
              • const is block-scoped and can not be re - assigned or re - declared.

2 <= difference between == and === in JavaScript ?
              • == in JavaScript is used  for comparing two variables, but, it ignores the datatype of a variable
              • === is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks the datatype and compares two values.
                Checks the equality of two operands without considering their type

3 <= async / await in JavaScript ?
              • async / await is a modern way to work with asynchronous code.The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function and it will return promise,
              • and await is used to pause execution until a Promise is resolved / rejected, allowing for more readable and sequential asynchronous code.

4 <= WHAT IS THE MAP FILTER AND REDUCE
              • map() transforms every element of an array individually and creates a new array.
              • filter() removes elements that are not required and creates a new array containing the ones needed.
              • reduce() reduces all array elements into a single value.
              • forEach() executes a provided function once for each array element but does not create a new array.

5 <= DIF SLICE AND SPLICE
              • Slice returns a piece of the array but it doesn't affect the original array
                It creates a new array based on a start index and end index
              • The splice method changes the original array by adding, removing, or replacing values and returns the affected Array.
                It takes three arguments the start index, count of deleteCount elements, and replacing elements.

6 <= What is a higher - order function?
              • A higher - order function is a function that either takes one or more
              • functions as arguments, and returns a function as its result.
              • map(), filter(), and reduce() are all higher - order functions because they take other functions as arguments.

7 <= difference between local Storage and session Storage ?
              • Local Storage and Session Storage are both used for storing data but the main difference is that: 
                Local Storage does not expire data and it has no expiration time.
                Session Storage clears the data when the browser or tab is closed

8 <= Synchronous and Asynchronous functions ?
              • Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before
                 it Each task requires an answer before moving on to the next iteration.  
              • Asynchronous is a non - blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn’t dependent on another task and can run simultaneously.

9 <= what is SQL and NOSQL
              •  SQL is Structured query language a type of database management system that uses a Structured schema and is base on
                 a relational model.It is suitable for applications with complex queries and transactions.
                 No SQL is a category of database management systems that do not strictly adhere to the traditional relational database  model
                 It provides more flexibility in data models and Scalability options.

10 <= what is shallow copy and Deep Copy
                •  A shallow copy duplicates only the outer object, while inner objects are shared between the original and the copy.
                •  A deep copy creates a full, independent copy of the object, including all nested objects.

11 <=* What are promises ?  
             • promise in JavaScript represents a task that will finish in the future.
                It can either succeed(resolve) or fail(reject).Promises help manage tasks
                that take time, like fetching data from the internet.

12 <= Promise.All and Promise.Any: -
    Promise.All: -
           • Promise.All is used to handle multiple promises at the same time.
           • It is only resolved when all given promises have been resolved successfully otherwise it returns reject
Promise.Any: -
           • Promise.Any is used to handle multiple promises at the same time.
           • It is resolved when as soon as any one of the promises resolves successfully 
           • If all promises reject then it returns reject

13 <= What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript ?
         • JavaScript is a scripting language and Node.js is an engine that provides the runtime environment to run JavaScript code.

14 <= What is Node.js ?
          • Node.js is run time envarment executing JavaScript code outside the browser.
            It is normally used to build the backend of the application and is highly scalable.
            it is used for creating server - side web applications

15 <= HOW NODE.JS WORKS ?
    Node.js is based on V8 engine, it is a virtule machine that 
            utilizes javascript as its scripting language and achievers high 
            output via non - blocking i / o and single threaded event loop.

16 <= What is NPM ?
          • NPM(Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js.
            It is used to install, share, and manage dependencies(libraries and tools) for Node.js projects.

17 <= How can you handle errors in Node.js ?
          • Errors in Node.js can be handled using try-catch blocks for synchronous code and using callback functions, Promises, or async/await
for asynchronous code.Additionally, Node.js has an event emitter pattern that can be utilized for error handling in certain scenarios.

18 <= What is MongoDB ?
          • MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that uses a document - oriented data model.
            It stores data in flexible, JSON - like BSON  documents, allowing for a dynamic and scalable schema

19 <= Explain the concept of a collection in MongoDB ?
          • collection In MongoDB is a group of documents that share a similar structure.
            it is equivalent to a table in a relation database

20 <= Difference between get and post methads ?
          • GET Retrieve data from the Server
          • POST Send data to the server to create a resource. 

21 <= what is the difference between put and patch
          • PUT method sends all data fields to the server, replacing them with new data.
    It's used when a client wants to fully update a resource.          
          • PATCH method only sends the data fields that need to be updated to the server,
    leaving others unchanged.It's used for partial updates of a resource.           

22 <= What is the Advantage of using Node.js?
         • Node.js is fast and scalable.Node.js is easy to learn and use.Node.js is
for real - time applications, such as chat applications, online games,
    and streaming services.This is because Node.js can handle a large number of connections
           and can perform non - blocking I / O operations, which makes it ideal for real - time communication.

23 <= What are the disadvantages of Node.js ?
         • Node.js is single - threaded so multi - threaded engines are better and can handle tasks more efficiently.
    Also, we do not use relational databases with Node.js like MySQL mostly non - relational databases like MongoDB are used.

24 <= What is REPL in Node.js ?
         • REPL in Node.js stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop.It is a computer environment similar
           to the shell which is useful for writing and debugging code as it executes the code in on go..

25 <= What is OAuth 
         • An open standard for authorization used for protecting APIs

26 <= jWT: 
         • JSON Web Tokens, a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object

         • A popular Framework for building web applications and APIs with Node.js.

28 <= What is sharding ?
         • sharding is the method for distributing data across multiple machines

29 <= What purpose of sharding ?
         •separates large databases into smaller faster, more easily managed parts

30 <= Why is Express.js used ?
         • Express.js is a widely used framework built using node.js
Express.js uses a management point that controls the flow of data between servers and
server - side applications being lightweight and  flexible, Express.js

31 <= What are node.js buffers ?
         • Buffer is temporary storage, usually in he Ram.It is handle raw binary data
           Instances of the Buffer class like arrays of integers The integers in a buffer each represent a byte
           the size of the Buffer is established when it is create and connot be resized
           When buffer is full then send out for processing during streaming

    Types: Readable, Writetable, Duplex, Transform

33 <= what is authantication and authorization
         • Authentication is the process of verifing the user, mean who are you
         • Authorization on the other hand is the process of determining what action a user allowed to do
             authorization is typically based on the authenticated identify and permission associated whit thet identity

         • process.nextTick: Runs code before the next event loop starts.
 
35 <= What is a cluster in Node.js ?
         • A cluster in Node.js lets you create multiple copies(workers) of your
           app running on different CPU cores.This improves performance by allowing
           your app to handle more requests at the same time.

36 <= What are child processes in Node.js ?
         • Child processes allow nodejs to handle multiple tasks coucurrently
           by creating subprocesses that can run independently

1 <= Aggregation Pipeline
         • The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB is a framework for data processing and transformation.
           It consists of multiple stages, where each stage performs an operation on the data and 
           passes the result to the next stage.A pipeline is represented as an array of operations,
    and each operation is specified as a stage
1.$match:Filters documents based on conditions.
          2.$group:Groups documents by a field and applies aggregate functions like sum, avg, etc.
          3.$project:Selects specific fields and reshapes the documents.

4 <= Aggregation Pipeline
         • The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB is a framework for data processing and transformation.
           It consists of multiple stages, where each stage performs an operation on the data and
           passes the result to the next stage.A pipeline is represented as an array of operations,

The event loop is a core part of Node.js that enables non - blocking I / O operations.
It uses the libuv library to handle asynchronous tasks.The event loop continuously
monitors and processes different queues, such as:
1)Timers Queue: Executes setTimeout and setInterval callbacks.
2)IO Queue: Handles callbacks for completed I / O operations.
3)Check Queue: Processes setImmediate callbacks.
4)Close Queue: Executes cleanup callbacks for closed resources.
Promises and async / await are handled in the microtask queue,
    which has higher priority than the other queues.This means 
promise callbacks will execute before moving to the next phase of the event loop.


15. What are streams in Node.js ? How do they work ?
    Streams in Node.js are objects that allow sequential reading or writing of data.
They handle large data sets efficiently by processing chunks of data without loading the entire file into memory.
Types of Streams:
Readable Streams: for read data(e.g., fs.createReadStream).
Writable Streams: for to write data(e.g., fs.createWriteStream).
Duplex Streams: for read and write(e.g., network sockets).
Transform Streams: for Modify data while reading and writing 
How They Work:
Streams work on the event - driven model:
Data Event: Emits when data chunks are available.
End Event: Emits when there is no more data.
Error Event: Emits if an error occurs.
Finish Event: Emits after writing completes.
